Provides a "Stars" rating system block for Gutenberg.

== Description ==
This plugin provides two Gutenberg blocks:

1. Stars Ratings - A "stars" rating system where you can select the quantity of stars.  Hover and click on the number desired, in half star increments.  Click on the current star rating to change it back to zero.
2. Stars Ratings Total - A special block that gives the total rating of all stars ratings on a current post.  You cannot choose the rating for this block since it is auto-generated, but you can choose the number of stars to use.  It should auto-update from all other non-"total" stars ratings blocks.

== Installation ==
Install like any other plugin, directly from your plugins page or manually by copying the files to the plugins/ folder.
